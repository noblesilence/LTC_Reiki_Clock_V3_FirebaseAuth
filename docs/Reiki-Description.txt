This app is a clock for Reiki practitioners. 

It provides a set of timers. Each timer corresponds to each hand position. A reminder sound plays when a timer finishes so that you know when to move your hand to the next position. Background music also plays; you can turn it on or off.

You can create your own set of timers. You can create as many timer sets as you need to suit each client. 

A default timer set includes 7 timers for 7 Chakras. Each timer is 3 minutes long. You may also change duration of each timer.
